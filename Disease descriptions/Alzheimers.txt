Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks.

In most people with the disease—those with the late-onset type—symptoms first appear in their mid-60s.

Early-onset Alzheimer’s occurs between a person’s 30s and mid-60s and is very rare.

Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia among older adults.
